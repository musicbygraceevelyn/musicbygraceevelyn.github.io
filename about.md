## About Me

{% include titleborder %}

I love helping every musician I work with improve their sound and feel more confident in the music they are delivering! I love details but I will keep rehearsals productive and upbeat. I hold a Masters of Music in Collaborative Piano from the Boston Conservatory at Berklee and live in the greater Boston area with my husband, our grand piano, and our rabbit named Curious George. Hope to meet you soon!

I love languages and I love helping my singers nail the pronunciation of the text when they're singing. I have studied English, French, German, Spanish and Italian and took a quick crash course in Czech. I have had the pleasure of visiting countries where these languages are spoken and been able to listen to native speakers. I would love to work with you to pass on what I have learned! In addition to pronunciation, we'll talk about the story behind the piece, find the story you want to share when you're performing, and work so you can sound your absolute best.

See my [vocal repertoire resumé](vocal_rep) for a partial listing of works performed.

I love the rehearsal process and enjoy discovering the music with my collaborators! My main focus is ensuring our overall sound is unified, balanced, and true to the composer's markings in the score. I have experience working with piano trios, quintets, and the following instruments one-on-one: Bassoon, Cello, Flute, French Horn, Harp, Marimba, Oboe, Saxophone, Viola, and Violin.

I have two decades of experience accompanying adult and children's choirs in various genres of music. Within the last four years, I have performed eleven times with the following orchestras: Brookline Symphony, Boston Conservatory Sinfonietta, Brevard Music Institute Orchestra, Vanity Lane Ballet pit orchestra, and Opera Susquehanna pit orchestra. I have had the pleasure to perform under acclaimed conductors Andrew Altenbach, JoAnn Falletta, Ken Lam, and Keith Lockhart.

Though my piano training was primarily in the classical tradition, I enjoy performing other styles as well, including gospel, musical theater, pop, and rock. Contact me if you need a pianist for events such as weddings, funerals, fundraising events, and parties.
