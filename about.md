## About

{% include titleborder %}

I love helping every musician I work with improve their sound and feel more confident in the music they are expressing! I love details but I will keep rehearsals productive and upbeat. With decades of experience, I can help prepare vocalists for full operatic roles as well as art song recitals and prepare instrumentalists for orchestral auditions. I enjoy working with composers and performing their newest works as well!  I hold a Masters of Music in Collaborative Piano from the Boston Conservatory at Berklee. I live and work in the greater Boston area with my husband, my piano, and our one car. We love music, Thai food, chocolate, and time spent with friends. I hope to meet you soon!

I love languages! And I love hearing you nail it while singing so that you sound like a native speaker. I have studied English, French, German, Spanish and Italian and took a quick crash course in Czech, and have the pleasure of visiting countries where these languages are spoken and have been able to listen to native speakers. I would love to work with you to pass on what I have learned and help you sound your absolute best. In addition to pronunciation, we'll talk about the story behind the lyrics and find the story you want to share when you're performing.

See my [vocal repertoire resume](vocal_rep) for a complete listing of works performed.

I have experience working with the following instruments in one-on-one and chamber music settings: Cello, Flute, French Horn, Oboe, Saxophone, Viola, and Violin.I love the rehearsal process and I enjoy discovering the music with those I work with. My main focus is on ensuring our overall sound is unified, balanced, and true to the composer's markings.

I have two decades of experience accompanying adult and children's choirs in many different genres of music, and am currently working as a choral accompanist in the Belmont public school system. Additionally, within the last three years, I have performed eight times with various college and community orchestras.
